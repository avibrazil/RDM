This is a tool that lets you use MacBook Pro Retina's highest and unsupported resolutions.
As an example, a Retina MacBook Pro 13" can be set to 3360×2100 maximum resolution, as
opposed to Apple's max supported 1680×1050. It is accessible from the menu bar.

You should prefer resolutions marked with ⚡️ (lightning), which indicates the resolution
is HiDPI or 2× or more dense in pixels.

For more practical results, add RDM.app to your Login Items in **System Preferences ➡ Users & Groups ➡ Login Items**.
This way RDM will run automatically on startup.

This software was studied and released [here](http://garethjenkins.com/2012/07/01/investigating-a-high-resolution-retina-utility-for-macbook-pro-1x-and-2x-modes/#comment-623)
and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/vi9yf/set_your_retina_macbook_pros_resolution_to/)
by its original authors. I just improved the build system and Makefile, fixed the icon,
added support for easy installable package (PKG, DMG) and improved the way menu is
displayed. I don't know what is the license by its authors because it came 100%
uncommented and undocumented. But I'm sure they would enjoy you to freely use it. Me too.

Want installable binary package? [It is here](http://avi.alkalay.net/software/RDM/).
